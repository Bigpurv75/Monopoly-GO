To write a complete programming language from scratch is a complex and time-consuming task that requires a deep understanding of language design, compilers, and computer science concepts. It is beyond the scope of a simple response here.

However, I can provide you with a simplified example of a programming language interpreter in Python. This example demonstrates the basic structure of an interpreter that can evaluate simple arithmetic expressions:

```python
import operator

# Define the supported operators and their corresponding functions
operators = {
    '+': operator.add,
    '-': operator.sub,
    '*': operator.mul,
    '/': operator.truediv
}

# Evaluate an arithmetic expression
def evaluate(expression):
    tokens = expression.split()
    stack = []

    for token in tokens:
        if token.isdigit():
            stack.append(int(token))
        elif token in operators:
            operand2 = stack.pop()
            operand1 = stack.pop()
            operation = operators[token]
            result = operation(operand1, operand2)
            stack.append(result)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid token: {token}")

    if len(stack) != 1:
        raise ValueError("Invalid expression")

    return stack[0]

# Example usage
expression = "5 + 4 * 2"
result = evaluate(expression)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

In this example, we define a dictionary `operators` that maps arithmetic operators to their corresponding Python functions. The `evaluate()` function takes an arithmetic expression as input, tokenizes it, and uses a stack-based approach to evaluate the expression based on the defined operators.

The example evaluates the expression "5 + 4 * 2" and prints the result.

Please note that this is a simplified example and does not cover all aspects of a full programming language. Developing a complete programming language involves many additional considerations, such as variable handling, control flow statements, loops, and more.
